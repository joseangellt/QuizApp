Hola, soy Joseangel. Sí llegaste aqui desde mi portafolio es porque estas aqui para ver mi trabajo. Este es un juego que hice de trivias de adivinar  las banderas del mundo utilizando view binding, xml, kotlin, etc.

Hi, my name is Joseangel. If you arrived here, that means you came from my portfolio and want to review my work. This is a simple app that I made for myself to help a person work out quickly and from home.
This app includes some additional functionality like a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, and a history feature that records all the routines you have completed with date and time. 
I kindly request you to download the app so you can evaluate my work.
To download the app, you need to download this repository and run it on Android Studio.
Thank you very much!
